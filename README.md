## About this Project
The objective for this project was to create a full-stack tech blog application that follows a MVC structure. This tech blog allows users to post, update, and comment on blog posts only if they have an account. If they do not have an account, they can only view current blog posts. This app was created using Handlebars, Heroku, Express, and Sequelize.
